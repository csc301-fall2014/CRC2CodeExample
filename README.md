CRC2CodeExample
===============

An example used in week 5, showing how to go from CRC cards ([designed during tutorial](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/CSC301H5F-home/blob/master/tutorial-week5/handout.md)) to runnable code.

The file [`ConsoleDemo.java`](src/csc301/examples/iteration1/ConsoleDemo.java) is an example of how to create a quick proof-of-concept of our object-oriented design.
